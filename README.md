## Install

### Install via composer

#### For Laravel <= 5.3, please use the [1.1 branch](https://github.com/squareboat/sql-doctor/tree/v1.1)!

```
$ composer require squareboat/sql-doctor
```

### Configure Laravel

> If you are using __laravel 5.5__ or higher you should skip this step.

If you are using laravel 5.4, simply add the service provider to your project's `config/app.php` file:

#### Service Provider
```
SquareBoat\SqlDoctor\SqlDoctorServiceProvider::class,
```

## Usage

Now while your `app.debug` is set `true` then on any URL you can append `?sql-doctor=1` and get an output of complete list of queries that ran.

| Query Param | Value | Output                                         |
| ----------- |:-----:| :--------------------------------------------- |
| sql-doctor  | 1     | Default query                                  |
| sql-doctor  | 2     | Binds values to their parameters in the query. |
