## Install

### Install via composer

```
$ composer require squareboat/sql-doctor
```

### Configure Laravel

Once installation operation is complete, simply add the service provider to your project's `config/app.php` file:

#### Service Provider
```
SquareBoat\SqlDoctor\SqlDoctorServiceProvider::class,
```

## Usage

Now while your `app.debug` is set `true` then on any URL you can append `?sql-doctor=1` and get an output of complete list of queries that ran.

| Query Param | Value | Output                   |
| ----------- |:-----:| :------------------------|
| sql-doctor  | 1     | Default query            |
| sql-doctor  | 2     | Query with binded values |
